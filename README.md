Lara Reserve Is a Laravel Package To Adds a Reservation feature to the laravel models.

# Installation


To Install Lara Reserve Run Following Command:

```shell
composer require shayanys/lara-reserve
```

and then run Migrations By:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

# Usage

## Initialize Models to Use Lara Reserve

To Add Lara Reserve Feature To Models, Your Models Should Implement `ReservableInterface` And use `Reservable` Trait.
And the Model Is Ready For Reserve By the Customer. And If Your Model Is a Customer, e.g. User model (Which Can Reserve
Reservables) Should Implement `CustomerInterface` And use `Customer` Trait.

### Example:

#### Reservable Model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphMany;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Interfaces\ReservableInterface;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Models\Reserve;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Traits\Reservable;

class Book extends Model implements ReservableInterface
{
    use HasFactory, Reservable;
}

```

#### Reservable Model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

// use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Interfaces\CustomerInterface;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Traits\Customer;

class User extends Authenticatable implements CustomerInterface
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable, Customer;

}


```

## Reservations

### Call `reserve` Method From Customer

you can reserve a reservable for a customer by reserve method of a customer model:

```php
$reservable = Book::first();
$customer = User::first();

$customer->reserve($reservable,now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',now()->addYear(),'00:00:00',['key' => 'value']);
```

in the above example, `$reservable` will reserve for `$customer`.
#### Parameters
1. reservable you want to reserve for customer
2. the desired date for the reservation
3. the desired time for the reservation in H:i:s format
4. the desired date for the end reservation - **optional**
5. the desired time for the end reservation in H:i:s format - **optional**
6. additional details for the reservation - **optional**

### Call `reserveForCustomer` Method From Reservable

```php
$reservable = Book::first();
$customer = User::first();

$reservable->reserveForCustomer($customer,now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',now()->addYear(),'00:00:00',['code' => 123]);
```

In the above example, like the previous example, `$reservable` will reserve for `$customer`. In the `reserveFroCustomer`

#### Parameters
1. the customer would you like to make a reservation for
2. the desired date for the reservation
3. the desired time for the reservation in H:i:s format
4. the desired date for the end reservation - **optional**
5. the desired time for the end reservation in H:i:s format - **optional**
6. additional details for the reservation - **optional**

### Call `reserveWithoutCustomer` Method From Reservable

```php
$reservable = Book::first();

$reservable->reserveWithoutCustomer(['name' => 'shayan'],now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',now()->addYear(),'00:00:00');
```

With this method, you can reserve a reservable without a customer.
#### Parameters
1. array of the reservation details
2. the desired date for the reservation
3. the desired time for the reservation in H:i:s format
4. the desired date for the end reservation - **optional**
5. the desired time for the end reservation in H:i:s format - **optional**

## Max allowed reserves

### Setting the maximum possible number of reservations on one date and time.

to set maximum allowed reserve in one date you should add `max_allowed_reserves` column to your reservable table in
database:

```php
Schema::table('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->integer('max_allowed_reserves')->nullable();
});
```

you can set `max_allowed_reserves` column of a reservable by calling `maxAllowedReserves` from reservable:
this method get `$max` to set it as value of `max_allowed_reserves` column.

```php
$tableToReserve = ReseturantTable::first();
$tableToReserve->maxAllowedReserves(5);
```

if you want to get the `max_allowed_reserves` from reservable you can do this:

```php
$tableToReserve = ReseturantTable::first();

$tableToReserve->getMaxAllowedReserves();
//or
$tableToReserve->max_allowed_reserves;
```

returns null if not exists or its null in database.

## Is available

`isAvailable` method can call from reservable and get two arguments date and optional time; and returns is that
reservable available in passed date and time (the time default is 00:00:00).

```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();

$airplaneSeat->isAvailable(\Carbon\Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d','2023-05-1'),'17:00:00');
```
This code returns true if `max_allowed_reserves` is less than count of all reserves in 2023-05-1 17:00:00; otherwise returns false.

## withoutCheckAvailability and withCheckAvailability
if you don't want to check the availability for some reasons you can use `withoutCheckAvailability` method:
```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();
$customer = User::first();

$airplaneSeat->withoutCheckAvailability()->reserveForCustomer($customer,now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',metadata:['code' => 123]);

//or call reserve method of customer like this:
$customer->reserve($airplaneSeat->withoutCheckAvailability(),now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',metadata:['key' => 'value']);
```
this code will bypass the check availability.

also you can set reservable to don't check availability by default:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphMany;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Interfaces\ReservableInterface;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Models\Reserve;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Traits\Reservable;

class AirplaneSeat extends Model implements ReservableInterface
{
    use HasFactory,Reservable;

    public function __construct(array $attributes = [])
    {
        parent::__construct($attributes);

        $this->checkAvailability = false;
    }
}
```
other way to modify this is to modify `shouldCheckAvailability` method:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphMany;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Interfaces\ReservableInterface;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Models\Reserve;
use ShayanYS\LaraReserve\Traits\Reservable;

class AirplaneSeat extends Model implements ReservableInterface
{
    use HasFactory,Reservable;

    public function shouldCheckAvailability() : bool{
        // TODO: Implement shouldCheckAvailability() method.
        return false;
    }
}
```
this will don't check availability by default. if you want check availability when you set `checkAvailability` property in constructor to false you should do this:
```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();
$customer = User::first();

$airplaneSeat->withCheckAvailability()->reserveForCustomer($customer,now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',metadata:['code' => 123]);

//or call reserve method of customer like this:
$customer->reserve($airplaneSeat->withCheckAvailability(),now()->addDay(),'00:00:00',metadata:['key' => 'value']);
```
this will check availability and then reserve.

# Get Reserves
you can get reserves from customer or reservable.
## activeReserves
```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();
$customer = User::first();

$airplaneSeat->activeReserves()->get(); 
// this will return collection of active reserves which reserved this reservable
//(the reservations that have a reserved date and time or end reservation date and time that are greater than or equal to the current date and time.)

$customer->activeReserves()->get();
// this will return collection of active reserves which reserved by this customer
//(the reservations that have a reserved date and time or end reservation date and time that are greater than or equal to the current date and time.)
```
the `activeReserves` method return a MorphMany relation you can call `get` method to get the collection of reserves; you can also call `paginate` method.

## allReserves
```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();
$customer = User::first();

$airplaneSeat->allReserves()->get(); 
// this will return collection of all reserves which reserved this reservable

$customer->allReserves()->get();
// this will return collection of all reserves which reserved by this customer
```
the `allReserves` method return a MorphMany relation you can call `get` method to get the collection of reserves; you can also call `paginate` method.

## startedReserves
```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();
$customer = User::first();

$airplaneSeat->startedReserves()->get(); 
// this will return collection of started reserves which reserved this reservable
//(the reservations that have a reserved date and time that are greater than or equal to the current date and time and end reservation date and time less than current date and time.)
$customer->startedReserves()->get();
// this will return collection of started reserves which reserved by this customer
//(the reservations that have a reserved date and time that are greater than or equal to the current date and time and end reservation date and time less than current date and time.)
```
the `startedReserves` method return a MorphMany relation you can call `get` method to get the collection of reserves; you can also call `paginate` method.

## endedReserves
```php
$airplaneSeat = AirplainSeat::first();
$customer = User::first();

$airplaneSeat->endedReserves()->get(); 
// this will return collection of ended reserves which reserved this reservable
//(the reservations that have a end reservation date and time that are greater than current date and time)
$customer->endedReserves()->get();
// this will return collection of ended reserves which reserved by this customer
//(the reservations that have a end reservation date and time that are greater than current date and time)
```
the `endedReserves` method return a MorphMany relation you can call `get` method to get the collection of reserves; you can also call `paginate` method.
